# Real-Time Mask Detection

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a real-time mask detection system using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. The system detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not wearing a mask at all in real-time video streams or images. The application of such a system is crucial in public spaces to ensure compliance with mask-wearing protocols and enhance public health safety, especially during pandemics like COVID-19.

## Features

- Real-time mask detection in video streams or images.
- Classification into three categories: wearing mask correctly, wearing mask incorrectly, and not wearing mask.
- High accuracy and efficiency in detection using deep learning models.
- Easy integration with existing surveillance systems or security cameras.


## Usage

1. Run the application using the above command.
2. Select the source of the video stream.
3. The system will detect faces in the video stream or image and classify them as wearing a mask  or not wearing a mask.
4. The results will be displayed on the screen in real-time.
